## Description:

Roman History Quiz is a quiz app that allows users to test their knowledge of ancient Roman history with a series of 10 questions. It is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about Roman history, or test their existing knowledge. The questions are surfaced in a random order from a selection of 15 possible questions - this ensures that the user can replay the quiz and be offered different questions each time. Once the quiz has finished, the user will be displayed with a different message depending on their score, with a 'reward' image being displayed to those who score 10/10. The user can then choose to play again to try and increase their score, or to see a different variety of questions.

## Design: 

The design of the website clearly lays out the description and instructions of the quiz in the header section, with the main quiz area below. Thematic colors and graphics are used to enhance the feel of the quiz, whilst not distracting the user. The questions are numbered from 1 to 10, with the 4 answer options being displayed in clear boxes below.
